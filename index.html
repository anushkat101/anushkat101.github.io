          <h2>decoration my headphones + pursuing ur happiness = ASMR</h2>
          <p>I had a good amount of stickers I wanted to put to use. I decided to use them to decorate my headphones!
            I saw a lot of inspiration on Pinterest in regards to this, so I thought it would be nice to film the process. 
            While filming, the video had a lot of unexpected ASMR as well which I thought was cool! Essentially, the video is just 
            me putting stickers on my headphones, satisfying noises, and me talking about how I overcame my fear of judgement and decided to 
            solely focus on doing things that made me happy- even if other people want to judge.
